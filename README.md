<h1 align="center">Solana RPC</h1>

> [!NOTE]
> This repo contains steps to configure a **slightly** more performant RPC than a **regular** one

## 🤖 Server

### Requirements

[Solana Hardware Compatibility List](https://solanahcl.org/) can be found here

- **CPU**
  - `2.8GHz` base clock speed, or faster
  - `16` cores / `32` threads, or more
  - SHA extensions instruction support
  - AMD Gen 3 or newer
  - Intel Ice Lake or newer
  - Higher clock speed is preferable over more cores
  - AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)
  - Support for AVX512f is helpful
- **RAM** 
  - `256GB` or more (for account indexes)
  - Error Correction Code (ECC) memory is suggested
  - Motherboard with 512GB capacity suggested
- **Disk**
  - **Accounts:** `500GB`, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)
  - **Ledger:** `1TB` or larger. High TBW suggested
  - **Snapshots:** `250GB` or larger. High TBW suggested
  - **OS:** (Optional) `500GB`, or larger. SATA OK

Consider a larger ledger disk if longer transaction history is required

> [!CAUTION]
> Accounts and ledger **should not be** stored on the same disk

### Sol User

Create a new Ubuntu user, named `sol`, for running the validator:

```bash
sudo adduser sol
```

It is a best practice to always run your validator as a non-root user, like the `sol` user we just created.

### Ports Opening

Note: RPC port remains closed, only SSH and gossip ports are opened.

For new machines with UFW disabled:

1. Add OpenSSH first to prevent lockout if you don't have password access
2. Open required ports
3. Close RPC port

```bash
sudo ufw enable

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8000:8020/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8000:8020/udp

sudo ufw deny 8899/tcp
sudo ufw deny 8899/udp

sudo ufw reload
```

### Hard Drive Setup

On your Ubuntu computer make sure that you have at least `2TB` of disk space mounted. You can check disk space using the `df` command:

```bash
df -h
```

To see the hard disk devices that you have available, use the list block devices command:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

#### Drive Formatting: Ledger

Assuming you have an nvme drive that is not formatted, you will have to format the drive and then mount it.

For example, if your computer has a device located at `/dev/nvme0n1`, then you can format the drive with the command:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme0n1
```
For your computer, the device name and location may be different.

Next, check that you now have a UUID for that device:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

In the fourth column, next to your device name, you should see a string of letters and numbers that look like this: `6abd1aa5-8422-4b18-8058-11f821fd3967`. That is the UUID for the device

#### Mounting Your Drive: Ledger

So far we have created a formatted drive, but you do not have access to it until you mount it. Make a directory for mounting your drive:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ledger
```

Next, change the ownership of the directory to your sol user:

```bash
sudo chown -R sol:sol /mnt/ledger
```

Now you can mount the drive:

```bash
sudo mount -o noatime /dev/nvme0n1 /mnt/ledger
```

#### Formatting And Mounting Drive: AccountsDB

You will also want to mount the accounts db on a separate hard drive. The process will be similar to the ledger example above.

Assuming you have device at `/dev/nvme1n1`, format the device and verify it exists:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1
```

Then verify the UUID for the device exists:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

Create a directory for mounting:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/accounts
```

Change the ownership of that directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R sol:sol /mnt/accounts
```

And lastly, mount the drive:

```bash
sudo mount -o noatime  /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/accounts
```


#### Modify fstab

```bash
sudo vi /etc/fstab
```

should contains something similar

```
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>

...

UUID="03477038-6fa7-4de3-9ca6-4b0aef52bf42" /mnt/ledger xfs defaults,noatime 0 2
UUID="68ff3738-f9f7-4423-a24c-68d989a2e496" /mnt/accounts xfs defaults,noatime 0 2
```

## 🌵 Agave Client

### Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

When building the master branch, please make sure you are using the latest stable rust version by running:

```bash
rustup update
rustup default nightly
rustup override set nightly
```

you may need to install libssl-dev, pkg-config, zlib1g-dev, protobuf etc.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler lld
```

### Download the source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave.git
cd agave

# let's asume we would like to build v2.18 of validator
export TAG="v2.1.18" 
git switch tags/$TAG --detach
```

### Add `profile.release-with-lto`

```bash
vi Cargo.toml
```

```diff
+[profile.release-with-lto]
+inherits = "release"
+lto = "fat"
+codegen-units = 1
```

```bash
vi ./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh
```

```diff
buildProfileArg='--profile release-with-debug'
      buildProfile='release-with-debug'
      shift
+elif [[ $1 = --release-with-lto ]]; then
+      buildProfileArg='--profile release-with-lto'
+      buildProfile='release-with-lto'
+      shift
elif [[ $1 = --validator-only ]]; then
      validatorOnly=true
      shift
```

### Build

```bash
export RUSTFLAGS="-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=lld -Ctarget-cpu=native"
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh  --release-with-lto --validator-only .
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```
# Building Solana Validators: Agave, Jito, Paladin

This guide outlines **how to build three Solana validator types from source**: Agave, Jito, and Paladin. It includes the official steps, as well as optional ideas for performance tuning or modifying build behavior.

---

## ✅ 1. Agave Validator (manual build with LTO)

Recommended if you want **maximum performance**, control over compilation, or building from a specific tag.

```bash
# Install Rust and system dependencies
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup update
rustup default nightly
rustup override set nightly

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang cmake make libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler lld

# Clone source
git clone https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave.git
cd agave
export TAG="v2.1.18"
git switch tags/$TAG --detach

# Enable LTO optimizations
cat >> Cargo.toml <<EOF
[profile.release-with-lto]
inherits = "release"
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
EOF

# Modify build script to accept LTO profile
# Edit ./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh manually or add:
buildProfileArg='--profile release-with-lto'
buildProfile='release-with-lto'

# Build validator only
export RUSTFLAGS="-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=lld -Ctarget-cpu=native"
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh --release-with-lto --validator-only .

# Add to PATH
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

---

## ⚡ 2. Jito Validator

Jito provides its own fork of Solana optimized for MEV, bundle processing, and high-frequency performance.

```bash
# Clean old version (optional)
cd ~ && rm -rf ~/jito-solana

# Clone repo and select tag
git clone https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana.git --recurse-submodules
cd jito-solana
export TAG=v2.0.15-jito
git checkout tags/$TAG
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build validator
CI_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) scripts/cargo-install-all.sh --validator-only ~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/"$TAG"

# Replace active_release symlink
cd ~/.local/share/solana/install/releases
rm -rf active_release
mv "$TAG" active_release

# Confirm version
$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/releases/active_release/bin/solana -V
```

> 🔍 **Note:** Jito validator binary is still called `agave-validator`. That's expected.

📌 **Tip:** Jito can be built with the same LTO profile method as Agave for slightly better runtime efficiency — though by default it's already optimized.

---

## 🛡️ 3. Paladin Validator

Paladin is a fork focused on security hardening and determinism, maintained by Paladin Bladesmith.

```bash
# Clone Paladin Solana
git clone --recursive https://github.com/paladin-bladesmith/paladin-solana.git
cd paladin-solana
git checkout v2.1.18-paladin

# Ensure submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build
./cargo build --release
```

🧠 Like Jito, Paladin still uses the binary name `agave-validator` — but version check will reflect `Paladin`.

> ⚠️ If using Paladin or Jito — always **check compatibility** with Jito relayer/block engine before mixing.

---

## 🧠 Summary Comparison

| Build       | LTO Optimized    | Target Audience              | Recommended For           |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Agave**   | ✅ (customizable) | General validators           | Max performance & tuning  |
| **Jito**    | ⚠️ Partially     | MEV/Bundle/BlockEngine users | Traders, power validators |
| **Paladin** | ❌ by default     | Security-focused forks       | Deterministic ops, audits |

---

## ✅ Optional: Enable LTO in Jito/Paladin (Advanced)

You can enable manual `release-with-lto` profile in Jito or Paladin:

1. Add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release-with-lto]
inherits = "release"
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
```

2. Adjust `cargo-install-all.sh` or build manually:

```bash
cargo build --release --profile release-with-lto
```

3. Export optimized binary path to `PATH`

---

## 🧩 Final Notes

* **Always pin exact tags** when building production validators
* **Do not mix builds** across networks (e.g., Agave binary on Jito relayer)
* **If unsure — use official releases** instead of building from source

Let me know if you'd like a version with logrotate, systemd service, or RAM-disk integration

## 🦾 System Tuning

### Set CPU Governor to `Performance`

```bash
echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

### Disable THP (Transparent Huge Pages)

Linux transparent huge page (THP) support allows the kernel to automatically promote regular memory pages into huge pages.
Huge pages reduces TLB pressure, but THP support introduces latency spikes when pages are promoted into huge pages and when memory compaction is triggered.

```bash
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

### Disable KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging)

Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM) is a feature that de-duplicates memory pages that contains identical data.
The merging process needs to lock the page tables and issue TLB shootdowns, leading to unpredictable memory access latencies.
KSM only operates on memory pages that has been opted in to samepage merging using `madvise(...MADV_MERGEABLE)`.
If needed KSM can be disabled system wide by running the following command:

```bash
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run
```

### Disable automatic NUMA memory balancing

Linux supports automatic page fault based NUMA memory balancing and manual page migration of memory between NUMA nodes.
Migration of memory pages between NUMA nodes will cause TLB shootdowns and page faults for applications using the affected memory

```bash
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
```

### Huge and Gigantic Pages

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/hugepages
sudo mount -t hugetlbfs -o pagesize=2097152,min_size=228589568 none /mnt/hugepages

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/gigantic
sudo mount -t hugetlbfs -o pagesize=1073741824,min_size=27917287424 none /mnt/gigantic

cat /proc/mounts | grep hugetlbfs
# none /mnt/hugepages hugetlbfs rw,seclabel,relatime,pagesize=2M,min_size=95124124 0 0
# none /mnt/gigantic hugetlbfs rw,seclabel,relatime,pagesize=1024M,min_size=540092137472 0 0
```

### Sysctl Tuning

```bash
sudo bash -c "cat >/etc/sysctl.d/21-agave-validator.conf <<EOF
# TCP Buffer Sizes (10k min, 87.38k default, 12M max)
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem=10240 87380 12582912
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem=10240 87380 12582912

# Increase UDP buffer sizes
net.core.rmem_default = 134217728
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
net.core.wmem_default = 134217728
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728

# TCP Optimization

net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf=1

# Kernel Optimization

vm.max_map_count = 2000000
vm.stat_interval=10
vm.dirty_ratio=40
vm.dirty_background_ratio=10
vm.min_free_kbytes=3000000
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=36000
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=3000
vm.dirtytime_expire_seconds=43200

# Increase number of allowed open file descriptors
fs.nr_open = 2000000

# Increase Sync interval (default is 3000)
fs.xfs.xfssyncd_centisecs = 10000
EOF"
```

```bash
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/21-agave-validator.conf
```

### Increase systemd and session file limits

Add

```ini
LimitNOFILE=2000000
```
to the `[Service]` section of your systemd service file, if you use one, otherwise add

```ini
DefaultLimitNOFILE=2000000
```

to the `[Manager]` section of `/etc/systemd/system.conf`.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```bash
sudo bash -c "cat >/etc/security/limits.d/90-solana-nofiles.conf <<EOF
# Increase process file descriptor count limit
* - nofile 2000000
EOF"
```

### Isolate one core for PoH

> [!NOTE]
> Many thanks for that guide to [ax | 1000x.sh](https://discord.com/channels/428295358100013066/811317327609856081/1257995317190852651)

find out the nearest available core. in most cases, it's core 2 (cores 0 and 1 are often used by the kernel). if you have more cores, you can choose another available nearest core.

#### Know your topology

```bash
lstopo
```

check your cores and hyperthreads
look at the "cores" table to find your core and its hyperthread. for example, if you choose core 2, its hyperthread might be 26 (in my case)

```bash
lscpu --all -e
```

the easiest way to find the hyperthread for eg core 2:

```bash
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/topology/thread_siblings_list
```

#### Isolate the core and its hyperthread

in my case the hyperthread for core 2 is 26
`/etc/default/grub` (dont forget to run update-grub and reboot afterwards) 

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_pstate=passive nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0 nohz_full=2,26 isolcpus=domain,managed_irq,2,26 irqaffinity=0-1,3-25,27-47"
```

```sh
update-grub
```

> [!NOTE]
> - `nohz_full=2,26` enables full dynamic ticks for core 2 and its hyperthread 26 to reducing overhead and latency.
> - `isolcpus=domain,managed_irq,2,26` isolates core 2 and hyperthread 26 from the general scheduler
> - `irqaffinity=0-1,3-25,27-47` directs interrupts away from core 2 and hyperthread 26 

#### Set the poh thread to core 2

add the cli to your validator

```
...
--experimental-poh-pinned-cpu-core 2 \ 
...
```

there is a bug with core_affinity if you isolate your cores: [link](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/issues/1968)

you can take the next bash script to identify the pid of solpohtickprod and set it to eg. core 2

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# main pid of agave-validator
agave_pid=$(pgrep -f "^agave-validator --identity")
if [ -z "$agave_pid" ]; then
    logger "set_affinity: agave_validator_404"
    exit 1
fi

# find thread id
thread_pid=$(ps -T -p $agave_pid -o spid,comm | grep 'solPohTickProd' | awk '{print $1}')
if [ -z "$thread_pid" ]; then
    logger "set_affinity: solPohTickProd_404"
    exit 1
fi

current_affinity=$(taskset -cp $thread_pid 2>&1 | awk '{print $NF}')
if [ "$current_affinity" == "2" ]; then
    logger "set_affinity: solPohTickProd_already_set"
    exit 1
else
    # set poh to cpu2
    sudo taskset -cp 2 $thread_pid
    logger "set_affinity: set_done"
     # $thread_pid
fi
```

## 🚀 Validator Startup

### Options

```bash

```

### Let's use the common one

```bash
mkdir -p /home/sol/bin
```

Next, open the [`validator.sh`](./bin/validator.sh) file for editing:

```bash
vi /home/sol/bin/validator.sh
```
Then

```bash
chmod +x /home/sol/bin/validator.sh
```

### Create a System Service

You can use the [`sol.service`](./system/sol.service) from this repo or `sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/sol.service` and paste

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Solana Validator
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
LimitNOFILE=2000000
LogRateLimitIntervalSec=0
User=sol
Environment="PATH=/home/sol/agave/bin"
Environment=SOLANA_METRICS_CONFIG=host=https://metrics.solana.com:8086,db=mainnet-beta,u=mainnet-beta_write,p=password
ExecStart=/home/sol/bin/validator.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Setup log rotation

You can use the [`logrotate.sol`](./logrotate.sol) from this repo run the next commands

```bash
cat > logrotate.sol <<EOF
/home/sol/agave-validator.log {
  rotate 7
  daily
  missingok
  postrotate
    systemctl kill -s USR1 sol.service
  endscript
}
EOF

sudo cp logrotate.sol /etc/logrotate.d/sol
systemctl restart logrotate.service
```

The validator log file, as specified by `--log ~/agave-validator.log`, can get very large over time and it's recommended that log rotation be configured.

The validator will re-open its log file when it receives the `USR1` signal, which is the basic primitive that enables log rotation.

If the validator is being started by a wrapper shell script, it is important to launch the process with `exec` (`exec agave-validator ...`) when using logrotate. This will prevent the `USR1` signal from being sent to the script's process instead of the validator's, which will kill them both.

### Enable and start System Service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now sol
```

```bash
sudo systemctl status sol.service
```

### Setup Shredstream Proxy

Jito’s ShredStream service delivers the lowest latency shreds from leaders on the Solana network, optimizing performance for high-frequency trading, validation, and RPC operations.
ShredStream ensures minimal latency for receiving shreds, which can save hundreds of milliseconds during trading on Solana—a critical advantage in high-frequency trading environments.
Additionally, it provides a redundant shred path for servers in remote locations, enhancing reliability and performance for users operating in less connected regions.
This makes ShredStream particularly valuable for traders, validators, and node operators who require the fastest and most reliable data to maintain a competitive edge.

#### Download the source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jito-labs/shredstream-proxy.git --recurse-submodules
cd shredstream-proxy
```

#### Build 

```bash
export RUSTFLAGS="-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=lld -Ctarget-cpu=native"
cargo build --release --bin jito-shredstream-proxy

mkdir ./bin
cp target/release/jito-shredstream-proxy ./bin/jito-shredstream-proxy
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

#### Preparation

1. Get your Solana [public key approved](https://web.miniextensions.com/WV3gZjFwqNqITsMufIEp)
2. Ensure your firewall is open.
  - Default port for incoming shreds is **20000/udp.**
  - NAT connections currently not supported.
  - If you use a firewall, see the firewall [configuration section](https://docs.jito.wtf/lowlatencytxnfeed/#firewall-configuration)
3. Find your TVU port

```bash
export LEDGER_DIR=/mnt/ledger; bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jito-labs/shredstream-proxy/master/scripts/get_tvu_port.sh)"
```


Next, open the [`shredstream.sh`](./bin/shredstream.sh) file for editing:

```bash
vi /home/sol/bin/shredstream.sh
```
Then

```bash
chmod +x /home/sol/bin/shredstream.sh
```

#### Create a System Service

You can use the [`shredstream.service`](./system/shredstream.service) from this repo or `sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/shredstream.service` and paste

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Shredstream Proxy
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
LogRateLimitIntervalSec=0
User=sol
Environment="PATH=/home/sol/shredstream-proxy/bin"
Environment="RUST_LOG=info"
ExecStart=/home/sol/bin/shredstream.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Enable and start System Service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now shredstream
```

```bash
sudo systemctl status shredstream.service
```
